        The Black Line Tavern restaurant and Alpen Deck event venue is now open
        year-round!
      </h2>
      <p>
        The expansive Alpen Deck built last fall makes outdoor dining and
        cocktails a special treat as the weather warms. Additionally, the
        restaurant is air-conditioned inside if you need toe scape the heat.
        Summer-Fall indoor and outdoor dining, with entertainment & events, will
        begin on June 22nd, and runs through October 29th. New hours have been
        added for both lunch and dinner Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays from
        11:30 to 10pm. with a new Sunday Brunch menu "lunch menu" from 11:00 in
        the mornings to 7:00 at night. The tavern is also open Monday & Tuesday
        for July 4th and Labor Day September 4th. Most Fridays will have
        7:00-9:00 PM SINGO games on the deck, and most Saturdays will have live
        music!

        With the new Alpen Deck, we are now a major southern Vermont area
        wedding venue! So with that in mind, there will be some operating days
        where we are closed for private events, so please refer to the Magic
        events calendar for those postings. If you're interested in planning a
        wedding or a major event/party, please reach out to BLT manager Josh
        Hearne jhearne@magicmtn.com or Kerry at kmara@magicmtn.com.
